Pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos v5 PAM module that supports
authentication, user ticket cache handling, simple authorization.

It can be configured through either options in the PAM configuration
itself or through entries in the system krb5.conf file, and it tries
to work around PAM implementation flaws in commonly-used PAM-enabled
applications such as OpenSSH and xdm.
