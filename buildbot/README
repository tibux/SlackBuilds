Buildbot is a continuous integration system designed to automate the
build/test cycle.

By automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each time
something has changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly,
before other developers are inconvenienced by the failure.

This requires python-twisted, jinja2, SQLAlchemy, simplejson.
