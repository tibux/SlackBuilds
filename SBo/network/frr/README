FRRouting is free software that manages various IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols.

Currently FRRouting supports BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv1,
RIPv2, RIPng, IS-IS, PIM-SM/MSDP and LDP as well as very early
support for EIGRP and NHRP.

Groupname and Username

You must have the 'frr' group and user to run this script,
for example:

    # groupadd -g 350 frr
    # useradd -d /var/run/frr -s /bin/false -u 350 -g frr frr

You also need a 'frrvty' group :

    # groupadd -g 349 frrvty

And to add 'frr' to 'frrvty' group

    # usermod -a -G frrvty frr

See /usr/doc/frr-*/README.SBo for configuration help.
