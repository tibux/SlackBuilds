# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bcc: BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and
bcc: manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples.
bcc: It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known
bcc: as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of
bcc: what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.
