BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and
manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples.
It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known
as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of
what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.

luajit is an optinal dependency (autodetected).
