Grouper.psp is part of grouper.

Internet2's Grouper Toolkit enables project managers, departments,
institutions and end users to create and manage institutional and
personal groups, roles, and permissions. It puts control of a group
in the hands of its steward and enables the person to manage the
membership and what resources it can access.

This requires apache-ant and grouper.
